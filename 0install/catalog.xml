You can use it to capture the state of your system before installing an app and after. By comparing the two, 0capture can then infer which capabilities the app has and should be represented in its feed.</description><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/0capture/</homepage><needs-terminal/><entry-point binary-name="0capture" command="run"/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0compile.xml"><name>0compile</name><summary>create a binary release from source code</summary><description>
0compile creates a binary from source code, either for your own use or ready for
publishing on the web through Zero Install. It can use Zero Install to download
any build dependencies (compilers, header files, build tools, etc).

This is useful if there is no binary for your platform, or if you wish to modify
the program in some way.

If plash is installed, it is used to sandbox the build so that it can't
accidentally modifiy any files outside of the build directory.

For a full tutorial, see 0compile's homepage.</description><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/0compile/</homepage><category>Development</category><needs-terminal/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0install-runenv-cli.xml"><name>0install-runenv-cli</name><summary>0install .NET helper for Windows</summary><description>

Publishing a program using Zero Install requires you to create an XML file
listing the available versions, where to get them, and what other software they
depend on.
  
This program provides a simple graphical interface for creating and editing
these feeds.</description><icon href="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0publish.png" type="image/png"/><icon href="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0publish.ico" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon"/><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/0publish-gui/</homepage><entry-point app-id="ZeroInstall.Publishing" binary-name="0publish-gui" command="run"/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0release.xml"><name>0release</name><summary>manage new releases with Zero Install</summary><description>
If you have a local feed in the development version of your program, 0release
can help you to create new releases easily.</description><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/0release/</homepage><category>Development</category><needs-terminal/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0repo.xml"><name>0repo</name><summary>manage a repository of 0install feeds</summary><description>
    0repo allows a group of developers to publish a set of feeds. It can be
    used by a single developer, generating a set of static files to publish on
    a web-server, or as a service which accepts signed updates from a group
    of developers.

    0template takes a template XML file (e.g. with place-holders for the version),
    fills in the place-holders, and then fills in everything else it can. For example,
    it will download the archive, fill in the size, calculate the digests, etc.

Use 0test to run the unit tests for a Zero Install program. You can use this to
test released versions or developer snapshots. You can give a selection of
versions to test, and you can test against different versions of dependencies to
create a matrix of test results.</description><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/0test/</homepage><category>Development</category><needs-terminal/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0watch.xml"><name>0watch</name><summary>scans websites for new releases and triggers 0template if required</summary><description>
    0watch scans websites for new releases using arbritary Python code snippets.
    When new releases are detected 0template is used to create/update a Zero Install feed.

FeedLint is a tool for Zero Install feed authors. It checks that your Zero
Install feed can be downloaded, that it is valid and that all the links in it
still work.

Run this on all your feeds from time-to-time to make sure they still work.</description><homepage>https://docs.0install.net/tools/feedlint/</homepage><category>Development</category><needs-terminal/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/0install/0install.xml"><name>Zero Install</name><summary>0install, the decentralized installation system</summary><description>Zero Install is a cross-platform, decentralized installation system.
