# repo.roscidus.com

http://repo.roscidus.com/ provides [Zero Install](http://0install.net/) feeds for programs and libraries where the upstream authors do not provide feeds of their own. It also serves as a semi-official repository for basic infrastructure components such as libraries and runtime environments. Some packages are created by hand, others are generated automatically from Debian packages. It is kindly hosted by the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/), and hosts only Free software.

This Git repository tracks changes to these feeds. The feeds are updated using the following tools:

[0watch](https://github.com/0install/0watch) scrapes upstream websites to discover new versions of applications. It runs a watch file (e.g., `ffmpeg.watch.py`) and then automatically calls 0template as needed.

[0template](https://github.com/0install/0template) is used to add new releases of applications. It takes a template (e.g., `ffmpeg.xml.template`) and values for placeholders (e.g., a version number) as input and generates a new feed (e.g., `ffmpeg-2.0.0.xml`) as output.

[0repo](https://github.com/0install/0repo) merges feeds generated by 0template (e.g., `ffmpeg-2.0.0.xml`) into the appropriate main (e.g., `ffmpeg.xml`).

We run this process periodically in a [CI environment](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/0install/repo-roscidus-com). You can also try it out on your own machine:
- `git clone https://github.com/0install/repo.roscidus.com.git feeds`  
  Note: The target directory **must** be called `feeds`.
- `./watch.sh` for Linux or `.\watch.ps1` for Windows  
  Note: These two scripts/platforms update two different subsets of the feeds. To update everything you need to run both.
