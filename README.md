This 0install repository provides feeds for programs and libraries where the upstream authors do not provide feeds of their own.
It also serves as a semi-official repository for basic infrastructure components such as libraries and runtime environments.

The contents of this repository are maintained using [0repo](https://github.com/0install/0repo).
Some packages are created by hand, others are generated automatically from Debian packages.

The [website](http://repo.roscidus.com/) is kindly hosted by the [FSF](http://www.fsf.org/), and hosts only Free software.
