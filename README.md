# apps.0install.net

https://apps.0install.net/ provides [Zero Install](http://0install.net/) feeds for apps where the upstream authors do not provide feeds of their own. It also serves as a repository for basic infrastructure components such as libraries and runtime environments.

## Adding new apps

If you wish to see a new app, tool or library added to this repository let us know by [creating a GitHub issue](https://github.com/0install/apps/issues/new) or even better by creating a pull request with [a feed you created](https://docs.0install.net/packaging/).

## Automatic updates

The feeds in this repository are updated using the following tools:

[0watch](https://github.com/0install/0watch) scrapes upstream websites to discover new versions of applications. It runs a watch file (e.g., `ffmpeg.watch.py`) and then automatically calls 0template as needed.

[0template](https://github.com/0install/0template) is used to add new releases of applications. It takes a template (e.g., `ffmpeg.xml.template`) and values for placeholders (e.g., a version number) as input and generates a new feed (e.g., `ffmpeg-2.0.0.xml`) as output.

[0repo](https://github.com/0install/0repo) merges feeds generated by 0template (e.g., `ffmpeg-2.0.0.xml`) into the appropriate main (e.g., `ffmpeg.xml`).

We use [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/) to automate these processes.

## Local setup

To work with this repository on your own machine run these commands inside an empty directory:

    git clone https://github.com/0install/apps.git --single-branch feeds
    git clone https://github.com/0install/apps.git --single-branch --branch=gh-pages public
    ln -s feeds/0repo-config.py .
    ln -s public/archives.db .
    mkdir incoming
    0install add 0repo https://github.com/0install/0repo

You can now run `feeds/watch.sh` (on Linux) or `feeds\watch.ps1` (on Windows) to search for new releases and `0repo` to update the feeds.

If you do not have the GnuPG key used to sign feeds in this repository, set the environment variable `NO_SIGN=1` before running `0repo`.
