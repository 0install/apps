    <description xml:lang="en">The main purpose of this utility is to recompress and test
the zip archives to get the smallest possible size.

For recompression the libdeflate implementation is used.
This implementation generally gives 5-10% more compression
than the zLib Deflate implementation, and it's also
generally faster.

For experimental purpose also the 7-Zip LZMA algorithm is
available with the -N option. In this case, the generated
zips WILL NOT BE USABLE by any other program. To make
them usable you need to recompress them without the -N
option. Generally this algorithm gives 10-20% more
compression than the zLib Deflate implementation.</description>

One unusual feature it offers is the ability to function as a format-conversion filter, reading entries from one archive and emitting an archive in a different format with the same contents. This feature was simple to implement because libarchive's robust automatic format detection makes it unnecessary to specify the format of the input archive. The bsdtar program has a number of advantages over previous tar implementations: 
•Library. Since the core functionality is in a library, it can be used by other tools, such as pkg_add. 
•Automatic format detection. Libarchive automatically detects the compression (none/gzip/bzip2) and format (old tar, ustar, gnutar, pax, cpio, iso9660, zip) when reading archives. It does this for any data source. 
•Pax Interchange Format Support. This is a POSIX/SUSv3 extension to the old &quot;ustar&quot; tar format that adds arbitrary extended attributes to each entry. Does everything that GNU tar format does, only better. 
•Handles file flags, ACLs, arbitrary pathnames, etc. Pax interchange format supports key/value attributes using an easily-extensible technique. Arbitrary pathnames, group names, user names, file sizes are part of the POSIX standard; libarchive extends this with support for file flags, ACLs, and arbitrary device numbers. 
•GNU tar support. Libarchive reads most GNU tar archives. If there is demand, this can be improved further.</description><category>Utility</category><homepage>https://www.libarchive.org/</homepage><entry-point binary-name="bsdtar" command="run">

    <description xml:lang="en">Dc is a reverse-polish desk  calculator  which  supports
       unlimited  precision  arithmetic.  It also allows you to
       define and call macros.   Normally  dc  reads  from  the

       it, they are filenames, and dc reads  and  executes  the
       contents  of  the  files  before  reading  from standard
       input.  All normal output is  to  standard  output;  all
       error output is to standard error.

       A  reverse-polish  calculator stores numbers on a stack.
       Entering a number pushes it on  the  stack.   Arithmetic
       operations  pop  arguments  off  the  stack and push the
       results.

       To enter a  number  in  dc,  type  the  digits  with  an
       optional  decimal  point.   Exponential  notation is not
       supported.  To enter a negative number, begin the number
       with  ``_''.   ``-'' cannot be used for this, as it is a
       binary operator for subtraction instead.  To  enter  two
       numbers in succession, separate them with spaces or new-
       lines.  These have no meaning as commands.</description>

Bison can be used to develop a wide range of language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so any correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison without any changes. If you know Yacc, you shouldn't have any trouble using Bison. You do need to be very proficient in C programming to be able to use Bison. Bison is only needed on systems that are used for development. 

If your system will be used for C development, you should install Bison. 

The package contains also the -ly library sometimes used by programs using Bison-generated parsers. If you are developing programs using Bison, you might want to link with this library. This library is not required by all Bison-generated parsers, but may be employed by simple programs to supply minimal support for the generated parsers.

This set of differences is often called a `diff' or `patch'. For files that are identical, diff normally produces no output; for binary (non-text) files, diff normally reports only that they are different. 

You can use the cmp command to show the offsets and line numbers where two files differ. cmp can also show all the characters that differ between the two files, side by side. 

You can use the diff3 command to show differences among three files. When two people have made independent changes to a common original, diff3 can report the differences between the original and the two changed versions, and can produce a merged file that contains both persons' changes together with warnings about conflicts. 

You can use the sdiff command to merge two files interactively.

This information typically includes system manufacturer, model name, serial number, BIOS version, asset tag as well as a lot of other details of varying level of interest and reliability depending on the manufacturer. This will often include usage status for the CPU sockets, expansion slots (e.g. AGP, PCI, ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel, USB). 
Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted. Dmidecode does not scan your hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to. 
Three additional tools come with dmidecode: 
•biosdecode prints all BIOS related information it can find 
•ownership retrieves the &quot;ownership tag&quot; that can be set on Compaq computers 
•vpddecode prints the &quot;vital product data&quot; information that can be found in almost all IBM computers 
This MS-Windows port is based on the patches created by Hugo Weber &lt;http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/dmidecode-devel/2006-10/msg00001.html&gt;. It works only on MS-Windows NT systems (NT, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008) and not on MS-Windows 9x systems (95, 98, ME).

    <summary xml:lang="en">dmidecode - DMI table decoder</summary>
    <description xml:lang="en">dmidecode  is  a tool for dumping a computer's DMI (some
       say SMBIOS) table contents in a  human-readable  format.
       This  table contains a description of the system's hard-
       ware components, as  well  as  other  useful  pieces  of
       information  such  as  serial numbers and BIOS revision.
       Thanks to this table, you can retrieve this  information
       without  having to probe for the actual hardware.  While
       this is a good point in terms of report speed and  safe-
       ness, this also makes the presented information possibly
       unreliable.

       The DMI table doesn't only describe what the  system  is
       currently  made of, it also can report the possible evo-
       lutions (such as the fastest supported CPU or the  maxi-
       mal amount of memory supported).

       SMBIOS  stands  for  System  Management  BIOS, while DMI
       stands for Desktop Management Interface. Both  standards
       are  tightly  related and developed by the DMTF (Desktop
       Management Task Force).

       As you run it, dmidecode will try to locate the DMI  ta-
       ble.  If  it succeeds, it will then parse this table and
       display a list of records like this one:

       Handle 0x0002, DMI type 2, 8 bytes.  Base Board Informa-
       tion
               Manufacturer: Intel
               Product Name: C440GX+
               Version: 727281-001
               Serial Number: INCY92700942

       Each record has:

       · A  handle.  This  is a unique identifier, which allows
         records to reference each other. For example,  proces-
         sor  records  usually  reference  cache memory records
         using their handles.

       · A type. The  SMBIOS  specification  defines  different
         types  of  elements a computer can be made of. In this
         example, the type is 2, which means  that  the  record
         contains &quot;Base Board Information&quot;.

       · A  size.  Each  record  has a 4-byte header (2 for the
         handle, 1 for the type, 1 for the size), the  rest  is
         used  by the record data. This value doesn't take text
         strings into account (these are placed at the  end  of
         the record), so the actual length of the record may be
         (and is often) greater than the displayed value.

       · Decoded values. The information  presented  of  course
         depends  on  the  type of record. Here, we learn about
         the board's manufacturer, model,  version  and  serial
         number.</description>

You might want to extract certain lines and discard the rest. Or you may need to make changes wherever certain patterns appear, but leave the rest of the file alone. Writing single-use programs for these tasks in languages such as C, C++ or Pascal is time-consuming and inconvenient. Such jobs are often easier with awk. The awk utility interprets a special-purpose programming language that makes it easy to handle simple data-reformatting jobs. The GNU implementation of awk is called gawk; it is fully compatible with the System V Release 4 version of awk. gawk is also compatible with the POSIX specification of the awk language. This means that all properly written awk programs should work with gawk. Thus, we usually don’t distinguish between gawk and other awk implementations. Using awk allows you to: 
•Manage small, personal databases 
•Generate reports 
•Validate data 
•Produce indexes and perform other document preparation tasks 
•Experiment with algorithms that you can adapt later to other computer languages. 

In addition, gawk provides facilities that make it easy to: 
•Extract bits and pieces of data for processing 
•Sort data 
•Perform simple network communications. 

The Win32 port has some limitations, In particular the ‘|&amp;’ operator and TCP/IP networking are not supported.

Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large projects
with speed and efficiency; it is used mainly for various open source projects,
most notably the Linux kernel.

Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools. Every Git
working directory is a full-fledged repository with full revision tracking
capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server.

This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision tree
visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web interface, is
provided as separate git* packages.</description><category>Development</category><icon href="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png" type="image/png"/></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/devel/git-for-windows.xml"><name>Git for Windows</name><summary>decentralized version control system</summary><description>Git is a powerful version control system aiming to be the fastest decentralized source code management tool on this planet.</description><category>Development</category><homepage>https://gitforwindows.org/</homepage><icon href="https://gitforwindows.org/img/gwindows_logo.png" type="image/png"/><entry-point binary-name="git" command="run">

    <description xml:lang="en">The  gzexe utility allows you to compress executables in
       place and have them automatically uncompress and execute
       when  you  run  them (at a penalty in performance).  For
       example if you execute ``gzexe  /usr/bin/gdb''  it  will
       create the following two files:
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 1026675 Jun  7 13:53 /usr/bin/gdb
           -rwxr-xr-x  1 root root 2304524 May 30 13:02 /usr/bin/gdb~
       /usr/bin/gdb~  is  the original file and /usr/bin/gdb is
       the self-uncompressing executable file.  You can  remove
       /usr/bin/gdb~  once you are sure that /usr/bin/gdb works
       properly.

       This utility is most useful on systems with  very  small
       disks.</description>

Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts.</description><homepage>https://nmap.org/</homepage><icon href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0install/apps/master/utils/nmap.ico" type="image/vnd.microsoft.icon"/><icon href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0install/apps/master/utils/nmap.png" type="image/png"/><category>Network</category><category>Utility</category><entry-point binary-name="nmap" command="run">

    <description>Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the Nmap Project as a much-improved reimplementation of the venerable Netcat. It uses both TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6 but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential uses.</description>

    <description>Nping is an open source tool for network packet generation, response analysis and response time measurement. Nping can generate network packets for a wide range of protocols, allowing users full control over protocol headers. While Nping can be used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress testing, ARP poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, etc. Nping's novel echo mode lets users see how packets change in transit between the source and destination hosts. That's a great way to understand firewall rules, detect packet corruption, and more.</description>

    <description>Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of Nmap scans. Specifically, it takes two Nmap XML output files and prints the differences between them: hosts coming up and down, ports becoming open or closed, and things like that. Ndiff can produce output in human-readable text or machine-readable XML formats. Many people like to scan their networks regularly (daily, weekly, etc.) and then use ndiff to easily detect any changes.</description>

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It
combines remarkable power with very clear syntax, and isn't difficult to learn.
It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level data types, and dynamic
typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to
various windowing systems (Tk, Mac, MFC, GTK+, Qt, wxWindows). New built-in
modules are easily written in C or C++. Python is also usable as an extension

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code. Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.</description><category>Development</category><homepage>http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/re2c.htm</homepage><entry-point binary-name="re2c" command="run">

The default behavior (with no options) is to extract into the current directory (and subdirectories below it) all files from the specified zipfile. A companion program, Zip, creates .zip archives; both programs are compatible with archives created by PKZIP and PKUNZIP for MS-DOS, but in many cases the program options or default behaviors differ. (For example, UnZip recreates the stored directory structure by default; PKUNZIP unpacks all files in the current directory by default.)

    <description xml:lang="en">unzipsfx  is a modified version of unzip(1L) designed to
       be prepended to existing ZIP archives in order  to  form
       self-extracting  archives.   Instead of taking its first
       non-flag argument to be the zipfile(s) to be  extracted,
       unzipsfx  seeks  itself  under  the name by which it was
       invoked and  tests  or  extracts  the  contents  of  the
       appended archive.  Because the executable stub adds bulk
       to the archive (the whole purpose of which is to  be  as
       small as possible), a number of the less-vital capabili-
       ties in regular unzip have been  removed.   Among  these
       are the usage (or help) screen, the listing and diagnos-
       tic functions (-l and -v),  the  ability  to  decompress
       older  compression  formats  (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink''
       and ``implode'' methods).  The ability to extract  to  a
       directory  other than the current one can be selected as
       a compile-time option, which is now enabled  by  default
       since  UnZipSFX  version  5.5.   Similary, decryption is
       supported as a compile-time option but should be avoided
       unless  the  attached  archive contains encrypted files.
       Starting with release 5.5, another  compile-time  option
       adds  a simple ``run command after extraction'' feature.
       This  feature  is  currently   incompatible   with   the
       ``extract  to  different directory'' feature and remains
       disabled by default.</description>

    <description xml:lang="en">zipinfo lists technical information about files in a ZIP

       tem or file system of compressing program, and the like.
       The default behavior (with no options) is to  list  sin-

Zip is useful for packaging a set of files for distribution, for archiving files, and for saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories. Zip puts one or more compressed files into a single ZIP archive, along with information about the files (name, path, date, time of last modification, protection, and check information to verify file integrity). An entire directory structure can be packed into a ZIP archive with a single command. 

Zip has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without compression. Zip automatically chooses the better of the two for each file. Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files.

Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the

pkg-config is a system for managing library compile and link flags that works
with automake and autoconf.

Increasingly libraries ship with &quot;.pc&quot; files that allow querying of the compiler
and linker flags needed to use them through the pkg-config(1) program.</description><category>Development</category><homepage>http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/</homepage></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/utils/pngcrush.xml"><name>pngcrush</name><summary>A tool for optimizing the compression of PNG files</summary><summary xml:lang="fr">Pngcrush est un optimiseur de fichiers PNG (Portable Network Graphics).</summary><summary xml:lang="pl">Pngcrush jest optymalizator dla PNG (Portable Network Graphics) plików.</summary><summary xml:lang="pt">O Pngcrush é um otimizador para arquivos PNG (Portable Network Graphics). </summary><summary xml:lang="ru">Pngcrush - это оптимизатор для PNG (Portable Network Graphics) файлов.</summary><summary xml:lang="sk">Pngcrush je optimalizátor pre PNG (Portable Network Graphics) súbory.</summary><summary xml:lang="es">Pngcrush es un optimizador de archivos PNG (Portable Network Graphics). </summary><summary xml:lang="sv">Pngcrush är en optimerare för PNG (Portable Network Graphics) filer.</summary><summary xml:lang="uk">Pngcrush – це оптимізатор для PNG (Portable Network Graphics) файлів.</summary><description xml:lang="en">Reduce the size of the PNG IDAT datastream by trying various compression levels and PNG filter methods.

Instead, it is used to filter text, i.e., it takes text input and performs some operation (or set of operations) on it and outputs the modified text. Sed is typically used for extracting part of a file using pattern matching or substituting multiple occurances of a string within a file. 

Version 1.4 is the fast, small sed originally distributed in the GNU toolkit and still distributed with Minix -- but it's still better for some uses (in particular, faster and less memory-intensive).
