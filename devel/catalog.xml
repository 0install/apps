    <summary xml:lang="en">a reverse-polish arbitrary precision calculator</summary>
    <description xml:lang="en">Dc is a reverse-polish desk  calculator  which  supports
       unlimited  precision  arithmetic.  It also allows you to
       define and call macros.   Normally  dc  reads  from  the
       standard  input;  if  any command arguments are given to
       it, they are filenames, and dc reads  and  executes  the
       contents  of  the  files  before  reading  from standard
       input.  All normal output is  to  standard  output;  all
       error output is to standard error.

       A  reverse-polish  calculator stores numbers on a stack.
       Entering a number pushes it on  the  stack.   Arithmetic
       operations  pop  arguments  off  the  stack and push the
       results.

       To enter a  number  in  dc,  type  the  digits  with  an
       optional  decimal  point.   Exponential  notation is not
       supported.  To enter a negative number, begin the number
       with  ``_''.   ``-'' cannot be used for this, as it is a
       binary operator for subtraction instead.  To  enter  two
       numbers in succession, separate them with spaces or new-
       lines.  These have no meaning as commands.</description>

Bison can be used to develop a wide range of language parsers, from ones used in simple desk calculators to complex programming languages. Bison is upwardly compatible with Yacc, so any correctly written Yacc grammar should work with Bison without any changes. If you know Yacc, you shouldn't have any trouble using Bison. You do need to be very proficient in C programming to be able to use Bison. Bison is only needed on systems that are used for development. 

If your system will be used for C development, you should install Bison. 

The package contains also the -ly library sometimes used by programs using Bison-generated parsers. If you are developing programs using Bison, you might want to link with this library. This library is not required by all Bison-generated parsers, but may be employed by simple programs to supply minimal support for the generated parsers.

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick &amp; easy development of user interfaces for
the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
GtkBuilder GTK+ object these can be loaded by applications dynamically as
needed.

By using GtkBuilder, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
languages including C, C++, C#, Vala, Java, Perl, Python,and others.</description><homepage>https://glade.gnome.org/</homepage><category>Development</category></interface><interface uri="https://apps.0install.net/devel/gcloud.xml"><name>Google Cloud SDK</name><summary>set of tools for Google Cloud Platform</summary><description>The Google Cloud SDK is a set of tools for the Google Cloud Platform.

Macros are either built-in or user-defined and can take any number of arguments. M4 also has built-in functions for including named files, running UNIX commands, doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways, and recursions. 

It can also be used as either a front-end to a compiler or as a macro processor in its own right. It is often used to generate HTML as it can give a consistent look to pages. If GNU `m4' is meant to serve GNU `autoconf', beware that `m4' should be fully installed prior to configuring `autoconf' itself.

Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code. Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.</description><category>Development</category><homepage>http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/re2c.htm</homepage><needs-terminal/><entry-point binary-name="re2c" command="run">
