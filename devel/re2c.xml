  <summary xml:lang="en">Re2C: convert regular expressions to C/C++</summary>
  <description xml:lang="en">re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C and C++. Its main goal is generating fast lexers: at least as fast as their reasonably optimized hand-coded counterparts. Instead of using traditional table-driven approach, re2c encodes the generated finite state automata directly in the form of conditional jumps and comparisons. The resulting programs are faster and often smaller than their table-driven analogues, and they are much easier to debug and understand. re2c applies quite a few optimizations in order to speed up and compress the generated code. Another distinctive feature is its flexible interface: instead of assuming a fixed program template, re2c lets the programmer write most of the interface code and adapt the generated lexer to any particular environment.</description>

    <description xml:lang="en">re2c  is a preprocessor that generates C-based recogniz-
       ers from regular expressions.  The input  to  re2c  con-
       sists  of  C/C++ source interleaved with comments of the
       form /*!re2c ... */  which  contain  scanner  specifica-
       tions.   In  the output these comments are replaced with
       code that, when executed, will find the next input token
       and then execute some user-supplied token-specific code.</description>
