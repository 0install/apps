    <summary xml:lang="en">a grep with Perl-compatible regular expressions.    </summary>
    <description xml:lang="en">pcregrep  searches  files for character patterns, in the
       same way as other grep commands do, but it uses the PCRE
       regular  expression library to support patterns that are
       compatible with the regular expressions of Perl  5.  See
       pcrepattern(3)  for  a  full  description  of syntax and
       semantics of the regular expressions that PCRE supports.

       Patterns,  whether  supplied on the command line or in a
       separate file, are given without delimiters.  For  exam-
       ple:

         pcregrep Thursday /etc/motd

       If  you  attempt to use delimiters (for example, by sur-
       rounding a pattern with slashes, as is  common  in  Perl
       scripts),  they  are interpreted as part of the pattern.
       Quotes can of course be used on the command line because
       they  are  interpreted by the shell, and indeed they are
       required if a pattern  contains  white  space  or  shell
       metacharacters.

       The  first  argument that follows any option settings is
       treated as the single pattern to be matched when neither
       -e  nor  -f is present.  Conversely, when one or both of
       these options are used to specify  patterns,  all  argu-
       ments are treated as path names. At least one of -e, -f,
       or an argument pattern must be provided.

       If no files are specified, pcregrep reads  the  standard
       input.  The  standard  input can also be referenced by a
       name consisting of a single hyphen.  For example:

         pcregrep some-pattern /file1 - /file3

       By default, each line that matches the pattern is copied
       to  the  standard  output, and if there is more than one
       file, the file name is output at the start of each line.
       However,  there are options that can change how pcregrep
       behaves. In particular, the -M option makes it  possible
       to  search  for patterns that span line boundaries. What
       defines a line boundary is controlled by the -N  (--new-
       line) option.

       Patterns   are  limited  to  8K  or  BUFSIZ  characters,
       whichever  is  the  greater.   BUFSIZ  is   defined   in
       &lt;stdio.h&gt;.

       If  the  LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE environment variable is set,
       pcregrep uses the value to set a locale when calling the
       PCRE  library.  The --locale option can be used to over-
       ride this.</description>

Using the Regex library, you can: 
•see if a string matches a specified pattern as a whole, and

Regex provides three groups of functions with which you can operate on regular expressions. One group--the GNU group--is more powerful but not completely compatible with the other two, namely the POSIX and Berkeley UNIX groups; its interface was designed specifically for GNU. The other groups have the same interfaces as do the regular expression functions in POSIX and Berkeley UNIX.

The POSIX 1003.1-2001 standard defines an application programming interface (API) for writing multithreaded applications. This interface is known more commonly as pthreads. A good number of modern operating systems include a threading library of some kind: Solaris (UI) threads, Win32 threads, DCE threads, DECthreads, or any of the draft revisions of the pthreads standard. The trend is that most of these systems are slowly adopting the pthreads standard API, with application developers following suit to reduce porting woes.  
Win32 does not, and is unlikely to ever, support pthreads natively. This project seeks to provide a freely available and high-quality solution to this problem.
