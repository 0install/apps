  <summary>the GNU Bourne Again shell</summary>
  <description>
Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating
system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on
Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh,
which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs Research version of Unix.

Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features from the
Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a conformant
implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of the IEEE POSIX
specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers functional improvements over sh
for both interactive and programming use.

Since bash is included on most Unix systems, this feed is mainly useful for
Windows systems, where it provides a binary of win-bash (http://win-
bash.sourceforge.net/).</description>
