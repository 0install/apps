  <description xml:lang="en">Less is a pager. A pager is a program that displays text files. Other pagers commonly in use are more and pg. Less is similar to more, but allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi. </description>

    <description xml:lang="en">Less is a program similar to more (1), but which  allows
       backward  movement  in the file as well as forward move-
       ment.  Also, less does not have to read the entire input

       starts up faster than text editors like  vi  (1).   Less
       uses  termcap  (or  terminfo on some systems), so it can
       run on a variety of terminals.  There  is  even  limited
       support  for  hardcopy terminals.  (On a hardcopy termi-
       nal, lines which should be printed at  the  top  of  the
       screen are prefixed with a caret.)</description>

    <summary xml:lang="en">specify key bindings for less</summary>
    <description xml:lang="en"> Lesskey  is  used to specify a set of key bindings to be
       used by less.  The input  file  is  a  text  file  which
       describes  the  key  bindings, If the input file is &quot;-&quot;,
       standard input is read.  If no input file is  specified,
       a  standard  filename  is  used as the name of the input
       file, which depends on the system being  used:  On  Unix
       systems,  $HOME/.lesskey  is  used;  on  MS-DOS systems,
       $HOME/_lesskey   is   used;   and   on   OS/2    systems
       $HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini if $HOME
       is undefined.  The output file is a binary file which is
       used  by  less.  If no output file is specified, and the
       environment  variable  LESSKEY  is  set,  the  value  of
       LESSKEY  is used as the name of the output file.  Other-
       wise, a standard filename is used as  the  name  of  the
       output  file, which depends on the system being used: On
       Unix and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is  used;  on  MS-DOS
       systems,  $HOME/_less  is  used;  and  on  OS/2 systems,
       $HOME/less.ini is used, or $INIT/less.ini  if  $HOME  is
       undefined.   If  the output file already exists, lesskey
       will overwrite it.</description>

       will read them as they come across.  This means that you
       do  not  have  to wait for the decoding to finish before
       less shows you the file.  This also means that you  will
       get  a  'byte N' instead of an N% as your file position.
       You can seek to the end and back to get the N% but  that
       means you have to wait for the pipe to finish.</description>
